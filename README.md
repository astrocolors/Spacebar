# Spacebar
Spacebar - a social media application that never left beta.

My first IOS application that I spent a ton of time on.

The application had 5 tabs - Messages, Short Clips, Videos, Notifications, and Profile.

I was toying around with a couple different backends (Firebase, PostgreSQL, AWS) but never fully committed to using one of them.

It was fun while it lasted.
